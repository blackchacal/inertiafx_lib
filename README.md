# InertiaFX_Lib

InertiaFX_Lib is a Physics Simulation library developed in C++.

The main goal is to provide physics simulation capabilities of various domains. It will start with Newtonian Mechanics, but it should evolve to add more advanced simulation scenarios from other branches of physics like Analytical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Waves and Optics, etc.
